Certain modules, such as CGI::Ajax and
JavaScript::Autocomplete::Backend,
require a minimal CGI.pm-compatible module to provide certain methods,
such as param() to fetch parameters. The standard module to
do this is of course L<CGI.pm>; however, especially in a mod_perl
environment, there may be concerns with the resultant memory footprint.
This module provides various CGI.pm-compatible methods via
mod_perl2 and librapreq2, and as such, it may be a viable
alternative in a mod_perl scenario.

Note that this module is not a drop-in replacement for
CGI.pm, as only a select few methods that naturally arise
in mod_perl2 and libapreq2 are provided. As well as providing
CGI.pm-compatible methods to other modules, one of the
main intents here is to assist development of porting 
CGI applications over to mod_perl2 and libapreq2 and/or
for use in writing applications
that are to be used in either a cgi or mod_perl environment. However,
for applications that are intended only for mod_perl, it is recommended
that the native interface to mod_perl2 and libapreq2 be used, as
this module will add some overhead. 

See the documentation for CGI::Apache2::Wrapper for details.

Installation proceeds through the usual
   perl Makefile.PL
   $MAKE
   $MAKE test
   $MAKE install
or, if Module::Build is available,
   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install
A ppm package for Win32 users of ActivePerl 8xx can be installed
by adding http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/ to your list
of repositories and then issuing the command
   C:\> ppm install CGI-Apache2-Wrapper
The corresponding repository for ActivePerl 10xx is
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/PPMPackages/10xx/.
